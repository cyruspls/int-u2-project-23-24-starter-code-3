    <h1>How does racism affect society?</h1>
    <h>Racism affects society by splitting up our society or unfairly treating certain people because of their skin or where they are from. This is not all that has to do with racism, many people are killed by police or robbed of jobs that they would have gotten had they been a different skin color. Obviously, this is bad and should never happen but there are many ways we can stop this.</h>

    <h1>How do we fix racism?</h1>
    <h>We can fix racism by simply making it illegal to be racist, or we help people connect with each other globally. Not only does this help fix racism but it also helps countries and people stay connected across the globe.</h>
